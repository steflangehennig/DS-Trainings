# DS-Trainings
Repo dedicated to data science training materials. This is intended for people new to data science and programming languages such as Python or R. Most files will be in `.Rmd` or `.ipynb` format for ease of seeing both the code, output, and extended annotations.

The repo includes (for now):

* Introduction to the `wbstats` package in R, which is used for accessing and analysing the World Bank's data via their API
* Introduction to R, with a special focus on using the `tidyverse` for data manipulation, visualisation, and analysing (_in progress_)

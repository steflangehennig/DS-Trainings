## R for the Win

This is a brief tutorial to get started using the programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). R is a very well documented programming language that is developing all the time.  

The tutorial will be based on the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of packages. 

### What is R?

### Installing R and R Studio

### Installing and Reading in Packages

Explain `install.packages()` and `library()` functions here.

#### A Quick Aside on the Beloved `tidyverse`

Provide a brief primer on base R and why the tidyverse is superior. 

### Importing Data

### Manipulating Data

### Visualisation using `ggplot2` 

### A Simple Model

### Conclusion

This simple introduction has introduced you to the programming language R; how to install the software; importing data and packages; and manipulating, visualising, and modelling data. While we have covered a lot of ground, we have only scratched surface in terms of what R has to offer. R has become a powerful tool in NLP/text analytics, machine learning, geospatial analyses, and interactive web applications (to name a few). Because of this, R has become a serious rival to the more computer programming-oriented language Python in data science.

### Resources

There are a number of resources out there to get you started and keep you learning in R. Hadley Wickham, one of R's biggest gurus, has a wealth of resources that are free and easily accessible to beginners; a simple Google search of him will spit back enough to get you well on your way. 

Other great resources include:

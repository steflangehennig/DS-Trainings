## R for the Win

This is a brief tutorial to get started using the programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). R is a very well documented programming language that is developing all the time. Hadley Wickham, one of R's biggest gurus, has a wealth of resources that are free and easily accessible to beginners. 

The tutorial will be based on the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of packages. 

### What is R?

### Installing R and R Studio

### Installing and Reading in Packages

#### The Beloved `tidyverse`

### Importing Data

### Manipulating Data

### Visualisation using `ggplot2` 

### A Simple Model

### Conclusion
